    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "ANSWER:  I believe nearest neighbors will suffer from an incomplete vocabulary leading to a much higher ambiguity of messages that contain some parts of a similar vocabulary.  This is then further exacerbated when calculating the distnace between points where certain words that are common to multiple classes may outweigh the importance of a singular missing value of a more unique word.  The key difference between Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression is the assumption of independence in features that the former employs.  From a document classification stanpoint, this may be beneficail especially when the vocabulary derived from the training data is not complete.  As noted above, there is ~20% of the dev data vocabulary missing from the training dictionary, so more singular, distinct words might want to be given the maximum weight if they are strongly related to a class as opposed to a diminishing magnitude caused by correlation with other features.  C is inversely related to regularization, so the smaller values lead to a higher penalty function.  So the more punitive regularization term will restrict overfitting weight values.  Thus as we relax the regularization (increase C), we would expect higher and higher magnitudes, which, when squared, yield higher sums."

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a logistic regression model using a \"l1\" penalty. Output the number of learned weights that are not equal to zero. How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a plot showing accuracy of the re-trained model vs. the vocabulary size you get when pruning unused features by adjusting the C parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.01 (the default is .0001)."

    "ANSWER:  The TfidfVectorizer has an additional layer of transform applied to the original results of the CountVectorizer.  Specfically, an inverse-document freqency transform is applied which attempts to eliminate some of the high-freuency raw strings, like articles, and give more credence based on document frequency (df) to other terms.  One potential problem is that the document frequency metric is being baised by spurious low frequency words that may be uncommon for a low count but common enough to be used in many contexts.  One way of addressing this would be to set a minimum threshold document frequency."
